# cq-viewer

Visualize CQ reports received with psk reporting software.

This software will take WSJT-X logs and parse out the CQ's, and make a heatmap of them. The heatmaps are generated using [leaf-heat](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.heat) for the [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) map system.
